        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of battered and fried fish, served with chips. Often considered the national dish of the United Kingdom, fish and chips originated in England in the 19th century. Today, the dish is a common takeaway food in numerous other countries, particularly English-speaking and Commonwealth nations.</p>
        <p>Fish and chip shops first appeared in the UK in the 1860s, and by 1910 there were over 25,000 of them across the UK. This increased to over 35,000 by the 1930s, but eventually decreased to approximately 10,000 by 2009. The British government safeguarded the supply of fish and chips during the First World War and again in the Second World War. It was one of the few foods in the UK not subject to rationing during the wars, which further contributed to its popularity.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
            <li>½ cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>¼ cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded coleslaw mix</li>
            <li>1 pound sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch wedges</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) fillets fresh or frozen whitefish such as haddock or cod, 1 inch thick</li>
            <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups puffed corn cereal or corn flakes, crushed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with foil and coat lightly with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Stir together yogurt, green onions, lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Stir in coleslaw. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Arrange sweet potatoes on prepared pan. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle with chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt; toss to coat. Bake in preheated oven until tender and browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rinse fish and pat dry with a paper towel. Stir together egg and water in a shallow dish. Mix together cereal, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper in another shallow dish. Dip each fillet in egg mixture, letting excess drip off; dip in cereal mixture, turning to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish and cook until just golden, about 3 minutes. Turn fish. Transfer skillet to oven. Bake until fish flakes easily, about 15 minutes. Serve with sweet potatoes and slaw.</li>
